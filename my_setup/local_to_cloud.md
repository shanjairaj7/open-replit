Quick Cloud Migration Summary

Core Replacements Needed

1. WebContainer → Cloud Containers

- Replace browser-based WebContainer with real Docker containers
- Each user project gets its own isolated container environment
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes) to manage scaling and lifecycle

2. Browser File System → Cloud Storage

- Replace in-memory files with persistent cloud storage (AWS S3/Google Cloud)
- Real-time file synchronization between UI and cloud containers
- Asset upload handling for PDFs, images, etc.

3. Browser Terminal → Cloud Terminal Service

- WebSocket-based terminal proxy to cloud containers
- Real shell access to actual Linux environments
- Persistent terminal sessions

New Requirements for Cloud

4. User Authentication & Project Management

- User accounts and login system
- Project ownership and organization
- Multi-tenant isolation (user A can't see user B's projects)

5. Asset Management System

- File upload service for PDFs, images, etc.
- CDN integration for fast asset serving
- Storage quotas and management

6. Database Integration (Supabase)

- Automatic Supabase project creation per user project
- Database credentials injection into containers
- Auth integration with each project's Supabase instance

7. Preview Service

- Dynamic subdomain/port routing for live previews
- Proxy service to route preview.yourproject.bolt.dev → user's container
- SSL certificate management for custom domains

Architecture Changes

Current: Browser → WebContainer API → Virtual Node.js
Cloud: Browser → Load Balancer → API Gateway → Container Service → Docker Container

Key Infrastructure:

- Container Orchestration: Kubernetes for container management
- File Storage: Cloud storage with real-time sync
- Database: PostgreSQL for user/project metadata + Supabase per project
- Networking: Load balancers, service mesh for container communication
- Asset Storage: CDN-backed storage for user uploads

Biggest Challenges

1. Container Resource Management: Scaling containers up/down based on usage
2. Real-time Synchronization: File changes between UI and cloud containers
3. Cost Management: Each user project needs significant cloud resources
4. Security Isolation: Ensuring user projects can't access each other
5. Supabase Integration: Programmatic creation and management of Supabase projects

The cloud version would be much more powerful (persistent projects, collaboration, asset handling) but significantly more complex and
expensive to operate than the current browser-only solution.
