ai document research app

prompt
> We're a research company, and we want to build an AI research assistant that can help our analysts make sense of large amounts of information. It should be able to ingest different types of documents - PDFs, web pages, Word docs - and build a knowledge graph that connects the dots between them. For example, if it reads a news article about a company and a research paper about a new technology, it should be able to connect them if the company is mentioned in the paper. I want to charge each user a subcription of $50/month as well, with another higher tier of $100/month, build the pricing page in a nice modal as well.

- horizon-884-1a242
  initial ui home page didnt have the proper research home page with the pricing modal. assistant page route had the input with the graph and key entities sections.
  initial version ingests web pages, ingest api didnt work, initial basic json error was fixed but ingest didnt work
  model didnt test the apis, integration and complex functionalities should change
