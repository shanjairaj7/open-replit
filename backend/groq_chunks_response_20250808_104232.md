## Request
I want to build a CRM web application with a clean, modern UI using a dark blue and blue color palette. The app should include user authentication (sign up, login, password reset) and have core CRM features like managing contacts, tracking leads, adding notes, tagging, and a basic dashboard for activity overview.

The interface should use deep blues for the background (for example, Tailwind's slate-900 or blue-950), mid-tone blues for primary elements (like blue-700 or blue-600), and lighter blues (such as blue-400 or sky-300) for accents and highlights. It should be responsive and easy to use on both desktop and mobile, and include features like quick-add, search, and filtering to keep workflows efficient. Design the structure so itâ€™s easy to add enhancements like email reminders, file uploads, or user roles in the future. Prioritize smooth navigation, security (input validation and protected routes), and straightforward setup for fast deployment and iteration
