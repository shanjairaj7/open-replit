### Key Configuration Files
- `frontend/tailwind.config.js`: Custom glassmorphism utilities
- `frontend/src/styles/theme.css`: Dark theme variables
- `backend/requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `frontend/package.json`: Frontend dependencies

## Route Implementation

### Frontend Routes
- `/` - Dashboard overview with project statistics
- `/project/:id` - Individual project board with Kanban view
- `/task/:id` - Task detail modal/page

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/projects` - List all projects
- `POST /api/projects` - Create new project
- `GET /api/projects/:id` - Get project details
- `GET /api/tasks` - List tasks (with filtering)
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create new task
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete task
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id/status` - Update task status (for drag-drop)
- `GET /api/teams` - List teams
- `POST /api/teams/:id/members` - Add team member
- `WS /ws` - WebSocket connection for real-time updates

## Data Flow

### Frontend State Management
- **React Query**: Manages server state (tasks, projects, teams)
- **Local State**: UI state (modals, selections, drag-drop)
- **WebSocket Context**: Real-time updates and notifications

### Backend Data Flow
1. REST API endpoints handle CRUD operations
2. WebSocket service broadcasts changes to connected clients
3. Notification service manages real-time alerts
4. Pydantic models ensure data validation

### Key Interactions
- Task creation → WebSocket broadcast → All clients update
- Drag-drop → Status update → Real-time sync
- Team member assignment → Notification → Activity feed update

- **Deployment**: Docker containers for easy deployment

## Technical Notes

### Important Implementation Details
- **Glassmorphism**: Achieved through CSS backdrop-filter and opacity
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Custom hook handles all drag states
- **Real-time**: WebSocket reconnection logic for reliability
- **Responsive**: Tailwind breakpoints for mobile support

### Special Considerations
