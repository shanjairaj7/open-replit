## Request
Create a comprehensive client management system for my consulting business. I need to track leads, manage ongoing projects, send invoices, and maintain client communication history. Core features: Lead pipeline with stages (prospect → qualified → proposal → won/lost), project tracking with time logging and milestone management, invoice generation with payment status tracking, client contact database with communication logs, automated follow-up reminders, and financial dashboard showing revenue, outstanding payments, and project profitability. Include search and filtering capabilities, bulk actions for emails, and export functionality for reports. Make it professional with a clean dashboard that gives me quick insights into my business health.
