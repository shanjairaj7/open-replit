QWEN_DATABASE_TEST_PROMPT = """
You are Qwen3 Coder. I'm building an AI coding system where you generate complete backend applications with databases. I need to choose the best database technology based on YOUR actual capabilities and knowledge.

Please honestly assess yourself:

**1. Database Technology Confidence (Rate 1-10 for generating working code)**
- SQLite + SQLAlchemy: ?/10
- PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy: ?/10  
- MongoDB + PyMongo: ?/10
- MySQL + SQLAlchemy: ?/10
- Redis + redis-py: ?/10

**2. What you know BEST**
Which database have you seen the most examples of in your training?
Which one can you generate the most reliable, complete code for?

**3. Quick Code Test - SQLite**
Generate a simple FastAPI + SQLite example right now:
- User model (id, email, username)
- CRUD endpoints  
- Complete working code
- Just show me database.py and models.py files

**4. Quick Code Test - PostgreSQL**
Same thing but with PostgreSQL:
- Show connection setup
- Migration handling
- Environment configuration

**5. Honest Assessment**
- What database tasks do you struggle with?
- What often breaks in your generated database code?
- Which setup is simplest for you to generate correctly?

**6. For a multi-project system where each project needs its own database:**
- SQLite file per project vs
- PostgreSQL schema per project vs  
- MongoDB database per project

Which approach would you generate the most reliable code for?

Be very honest - this determines our entire database architecture!
