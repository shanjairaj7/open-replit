# Bolt.diy Local-to-Cloud Migration Checklist

This is a comprehensive, actionable checklist for migrating bolt.diy from browser-based WebContainer to cloud-based infrastructure while maintaining **identical functionality**.

## Overview & Success Criteria

**Migration Goal**: Replicate the exact functionality that currently works in the browser (file operations, terminal commands, live preview, and AI integration) in a cloud environment with no functionality changes or new features.

**Key Architectural Change**: Replace WebContainer with Docker containers that are directly accessible via container networking, eliminating the need for domains during development.

**Non-Negotiable Requirements**:
- ✅ Zero functionality loss
- ✅ Same user experience
- ✅ Same performance characteristics  
- ✅ All current features work identically
- ✅ No domain dependencies - direct container access
